I really suck at updating this site kinda regulary..  
So, what has changed?  
Not much.. the MP10 broke in January again, got a Sunlu S8+ with a nice glass printbed in March.  
Bought some film from Lomography, the Analogue Quartett and Metropolis Tokyo Edition, shot that roll first, curious to see how the pictures turn out.  
With that order i got the Fisheye One Hello-Kitty Edition for free, it's cute^^ perfect for kitty pics.  
  
now my newest Toy, a TS80P, just got it yesterday and I love it to death, fits in my hand perfectly.  
  

maybe it's good nobody sees this site, then i don't have to feel guilty for not updating it that much  
afterall, i'm just an unlikeable, boring person with no good traits
