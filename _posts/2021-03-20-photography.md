Hi there, long time no post.  
I'm not dead, in fact I just renewed this domain for another year^^  

As the title states, this is kinda about photography, what it doesn't state is that I mean film photography,  
thats right, I picked up a film camera off ebay for 20 bucks, and I like it very much.  
I'm still on my first roll of 135 film and only after getting it developed I'll know if the camera works as it should,  
but if it does (which i hope) I'll be very happy^^  

I'll post some scans of negatives once I got them developed.
